# /dev/uino
A standard device library for Arduino and other -ino's

It's a mess here right now, but work is going on!
The goal with ths project is to create a clean and well-coded library for all kinds of devices attachable to Arduinos.

Currently the source/roadmap file contain the layout for the library.
